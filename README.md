#### The ultimate guide to *learning to code* & full stack development that will *land you a job* in no time 🔥

![Programming logos](./assets/logos.png)

## Foreword

Hi,

I'm James, a self-taught software developer, and this guide is the roadmap I wish I had as I endeavored to learn programming with the ultimate goal of being employed as a software developer. Successful as I was, it was a journey fraught with peril and with the knowledge I have today, there are many things I would do differently & better. You can learn more about my journey [here ->](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP0-oYGiqts)
 
With this guide, hopefully you too can learn to code (even if you have no prior experience) and land your developer role! 

> If you're enjoying the guide, consider *staring ⭐️* & sharing the repo :P Or check out the interactive [version](https://www.smoljames.com)🔥

## Projects

Now that you've got the knowledge you need to start building some wicked full stack web applications, here's my recommendation for the best trio of projects to include in your web portfolio.

**Projects do not need to be overly complex, just clean and well coded**

### Recommended

1. [Web portfolio](https://youtu.be/ylCUH6LkW80) -> You'll need somewhere to store you work.
*Recommended to use a JavaScript framework combined with TailwindCSS*

2. Frontend Framework (e.g. React.js or Next.js) that consumes an API (weather app, pokemon pokedex etc.).

3. An API project that uses the REST methodologies with Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. Bonus points if you can contain it within a Docker Container and combine it with the ChatGPT API.

4. A Full Stack project using a frontend framework (React.js or SvelteKit), Firebase auth, Firebase Firestore database & TailwindCSS. This could be a calender app, a todo app, or even a recipe app.

*This part cannot be understated and is equally important as the entirety of the learning to code section!*

## Extra For Experts

To make the process a hint more fun and engaging, there's a few extracurricular activities happening on the regular that you might wish to participate in! 

* **Builder Streams** -> Weekly streams @ **2pm EDT** time where we'll spend some time developing projects and doing other programming related things!
* **Project Feedback** -> Get feedback and assistance on your project in the *#share-your-projects* channel in the Discord.
* **Mock Interviews** -> Practice your interview skills with some mock interviews (they might get uploaded to the channel so be prepared :D).
* **Coding Battles** -> Nothing like a challenge and in the coding battles we'll see who can program different things faster.

## Final Words

This journey can be challenging, even at the best of times. But with some patience & consistency you can absolutely become an extremely capable developer and have a successful career in tech, or just build hella bomb projects for the memes - it's up to you :P There's loads of us on this path together so just keep in mind that there's always a community here to support you along the way and we're pretty active in the Discord chat if you want to come hang out!

Cheers,

James
