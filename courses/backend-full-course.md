### **Description**  

#### **Why is this the right Node.js course for you?**  
This course is your all-in-one guide to mastering backend development with Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and Docker. It‚Äôs designed for beginners and intermediates alike, progressing from foundational concepts to real-world applications without requiring hundreds of hours to complete.  

You‚Äôll learn everything from how the internet works to how to build and deploy RESTful backend systems step-by-step. Through theory, practical examples, and fun projects, you‚Äôll gain both the knowledge and hands-on experience needed to become a confident backend developer.  

We gradually develop 4 different backend projects, each building on the concepts learned in the previous one. This progression ensures that you‚Äôre always learning something new while solidifying your foundational skills.

### **What You‚Äôll Build**  

- **Chapter 1:** A foundational theory lesson that explains how the full stack works and how the internet enables applications to communicate.  
- **Chapter 2:** A beginner Node.js backend project that introduces you to backend basics, including REST APIs and CRUD operations.  
- **Chapter 3:** A Node.js + Express.js backend app with SQLite that incorporates JWT authentication, serves a frontend, and integrates a SQLite database for data storage.  
- **Chapter 4:** A full-stack project using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, and Docker. This project replicates Chapter 3 but transitions to more advanced tools and containerization with Docker.
