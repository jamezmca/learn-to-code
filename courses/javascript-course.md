## Description

### Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?

This course will teach you everything you need to know to dive into JavaScript development today üî• But even more than that, it teaches it via a curriculum that won't take you hundreds of hours to complete. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.

You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.

You will become ready to continue learning advanced front-end frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, or SvelteKit.

You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.

And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript from the ground up!

By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews, build insane applications with JavaScript, and become a professional developer.

### Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?

My name is James, and I've helped over 500,000 individuals just like you learn to code. I self-taught programming and understand how challenging it can be to learn to code; but I don't want it to be hard for you. This course is the course I wish I had back when I was learning to become a JavaScript pro in a comfortable amount of time. 

I am also an experienced web developer and designer, and have experience teaching programming, sciences and mathematics for over 10 years. I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum. It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges, that will take you from zero to absolute hero and you will be a confident JavaScript developer no time at all.

### So what exactly is covered in the course?

- Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns
- Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more
- Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more
- Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
- Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]
- Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel, Babel, and ES6 modules
