## Description

### Why is this the right React.js course for you?

This course will teach you how to build real-world applications with **React.js** while keeping it fun, practical, and beginner-friendly. We focus on hands-on learning by building projects that not only give you the ultimate React.JS education, but also allow you to confidently showcase your skills to potential employers or clients. You‚Äôll also learn to quickly style your apps with **FantaCSS**, a utility-first CSS framework, and handle authentication and persistent data management with **Firebase**.

Instead of getting lost in theory, you‚Äôll jump right into creating fully functional and super fun apps that are deployed live to the internet. By the end, you'll have projects that demonstrate your readiness for a software developer role!

### What you'll build:

In this course, you'll build three complete React.js projects from scratch:

1. **Todo App**  
   A simple yet powerful task management app to help you get started with the basics of React.js, state management, and component architecture.

2. **Pokedex**  
   A dynamic app that fetches data from an external API to display information about various Pok√©mon, teaching you how to handle API requests and data rendering.

3. **Coffee Tracker**  
   A more advanced app called Caffiend that uses Firebase for user authentication and Firestore as a database, perfect for tracking your daily coffee consumption with real-time updates and secure user data management, and also gives you some cool statistics about your coffee habits.

### Course Structure

- **Chapter 1: Building a Todo App with React.js Basics**  
  We'll start off at the very beginning by setting up your React.js development environment and building the core structure of a Todo app. You‚Äôll learn about components, props, state, and the essential building blocks of React.

- **Chapter 2: Creating the Pokedex with API Integration**  
  In this chapter, we'll advance to a slightly more complex app where you'll learn how to fetch and display data from an external API in a dynamic way. We'll cover hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`, making your app interactive and responsive.

- **Chapter 3: Developing the Coffee Tracker with Firebase**  
  In the final chapter, we consolidate our existing knowledge in addition to learning about React.JS for Full Stack development as we implement Firebase authentication and Firestore database to manage user logins and store data securely. This will prepare you to build more complex apps in the future.
