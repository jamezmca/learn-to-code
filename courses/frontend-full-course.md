### **Course Description**

#### **Why is this the right frontend development course for you?**
This course is designed to teach you modern frontend development by building a full application three times over — once with **React.js**, once with **Svelte**, and once with **Vue.js**.

By the end of the course, you’ll deeply understand:
- How these frameworks think.
- How to build dynamic web apps.
- How to manage state, handle events, and navigate routes.
- And how to compare frameworks confidently!

These three are not just popular — they're **foundational**. Once you’ve learned React, Svelte, and Vue, you'll have the skills to easily pick up any other frontend framework or library.

Plus, our app is pre-styled to keep the focus purely on **JavaScript frameworks and development concepts.**

---

### **What You’ll Build**
- **React.js:** Build a fully functional app from scratch, understanding components, hooks, and state management.
- **Svelte:** Build the same app with Svelte’s reactive, compiler-first approach for lightning-fast development.
- **Vue.js:** Recreate the app in Vue with its intuitive syntax and flexible features.

Repetition across frameworks locks in your understanding and helps you see the differences clearly.

---

### **What You’ll Learn**
- Modern frontend development workflows.
- Building apps with reusable components.
- State management across frameworks.
- Handling events and user interactions.
- Client-side routing for single-page applications (SPAs).
- Understanding reactivity and lifecycle hooks.
- Key similarities and differences between frameworks.
- How to choose the right framework for your projects.
