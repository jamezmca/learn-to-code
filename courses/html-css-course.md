## Description

### Why is this the right HTML & CSS course for you?

This course will teach you everything you need to know about web development with HTML & CSS to start build your own amazing websites today üî• But even more than that, it teaches it via a curriculum that won't take you hundreds of hours to complete. It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of HTML & CSS, all the way to building modern and complex websites & web applications.

You will learn modern HTML & CSS from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through practical and fun code examples, important theory about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and beautiful and complete projects.

We will gradually progress our knowledge as we develop 3 different projects, where each project is ever-so-slightly more sophisticated than the last. This gentle progression will allow us to be continuously learning and applying new concepts throughout the course.

**In Chapter 1**, we build a very basic website to learn the fundamentals of web development with HTML & CSS.

**In Chapter 2**, we build the Google Search homepage, a website that is trafficked by millions of people every day, and also a project I did myself at the start of my own learn to code journey.

**And in Chapter 3**, we build a professional and modern developer portfolio website that is of the calibre needed to land you a job. You can fill it out with your own experience and projects and we also deploy it live to the internet so that you have a link that you can share with your family and friends!

You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need in your developer job.

And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so you don't have to buy any other course in order to master HTML & CSS from the ground up!

By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews, build insane web applications with HTML & CSS, and become a professional developer.
